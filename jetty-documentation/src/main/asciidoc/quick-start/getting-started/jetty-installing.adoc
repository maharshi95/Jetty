=== Downloading Jetty

==== Downloading the Jetty Distribution

The standalone Jetty distribution is available for download from the Eclipse Foundation:
____
*Jetty*
http://download.eclipse.org/jetty
____

It is available in both zip and gzip formats; download the one most appropriate for your system. 
Notice that there are a number of other files with extensions of .sha or .md5 which are checksum files. 
When you download and unpack the binary, it is extracted into a directory called `jetty-distribution-VERSION.` 
Put this directory in a convenient location. 
The rest of the instructions in this documentation refer to this location as either `JETTY_HOME` or as `$(jetty.home).`
